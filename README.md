A comprehensive machine learning solution for credit risk assessment using alternative data to enhance financial inclusion, implemented in R with ethical AI considerations.

## 📊 Overview

This project demonstrates how alternative data sources (employment stability, housing patterns, transaction behaviors) can significantly improve credit risk prediction while promoting financial inclusion for underserved populations. The solution achieves **11.8% higher AUC** compared to traditional credit scoring methods.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🤖 **Multiple ML Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- 📈 **Performance Metrics**: AUC-ROC (0.748), Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- 🌍 **Financial Inclusion**: Assesses creditworthiness using alternative data
- ⚖️ **Ethical AI Framework**: Comprehensive O'Neil Risk Checklist assessment
- 📊 **Extensive EDA**: 20+ visualizations for deep insights
- 🔍 **Model Interpretability**: Feature importance and SHAP-like analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 📈 Results

### Model Performance Comparison

| Model | AUC | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|-----|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.721 | 0.643 | 0.808 | 0.643 | 0.716 |
| Random Forest | **0.748** | **0.733** | 0.793 | **0.838** | **0.815** |
| XGBoost | 0.730 | 0.660 | 0.807 | 0.676 | 0.736 |

### Key Achievements

✅ **11.8% AUC improvement** over traditional methods  
✅ **83.8% recall** for identifying good credit risks  
✅ **73.3% accuracy** in credit risk classification  
✅ **6/10 top features** from alternative data sources

## 💡 Ethical Impact Assessment

Our solution includes a comprehensive ethical framework:

- **Fairness**: Minimal demographic disparities detected
- **Transparency**: Feature importance and model interpretability
- **Privacy**: Data anonymization and compliance with regulations
- **Redress**: Proposed appeal mechanisms for customers

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM (6.2/10) - Implementation recommended with monitoring

## 🎓 Case Study Components

1. **Literature Review** - 10 research papers on alternative credit scoring
2. **Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values and feature engineering
3. **Model Implementation** - Three ML algorithms with hyperparameter tuning
4. **Performance Comparison** - Traditional vs. alternative data approaches
5. **Financial Inclusion Analysis** - Demographic impact assessment
